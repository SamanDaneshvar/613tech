Windows 10 has some serious shortcomings when it comes to default apps. Many times the app you want to assign to a filetype does not even show up in the *Open with* list. [**Default Programs Editor**](https://defaultprogramseditor.com/) is a very useful tool that helps you add the apps you wish, to the *Open with* list of any file extension.

To modify the default apps list for a specific filetype:
1. On the main screen of the app, click on `File Type Settings → Change 'Open with' programs`.
1. Find the extension you are looking to modify, and modify the list on the next page.

In case the extension is not on the above-mentioned list, try the following:
1. Locate a file with that extension, and open its *Properties*.
1. `General` tab → Under `Opens with`, click the `Change...` button.
1. `More apps` → `Look for another app on this PC`
1. Select the desired app.
