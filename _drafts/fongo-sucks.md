- Fongo is a cheap company, designed for free users and ad revenue.
- They have the worst customer service.
- Fongo is essentially a dead company, as far as technology companies go.
- The user interface of their app hasn't been upgraded for more than 10 years.
- The company has been put on auto-pilot.
- They charge $25 for port-ins.
- Shady business practices.

## Far better alternatives
### VoIP service + softphone app (in Canada and the US)
### Google Voice (in the US)
### Google Hangouts
