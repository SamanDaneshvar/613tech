In this article, I am going to tell you a bit about my approach to buying electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.). I should first tell you a little about myself because that might help put the things I have written in this article in perspective.

I am a Computer Engineer, so having powerful devices and access to the most recent technology is very important to me. At the same time, I'm not one of those people who has to have the latest phone right away. I tend to buy a new phone every 4 years and a new laptop computer every 6 years. Software upgrades are way more important than hardware. Even after four years, my phone and computer still feel quite fast. Of course, some of that comes from taking good care of your device. When I upgrade, I choose the newest model on the market, and then I am happy for another 4 to 6 years. Now, here are some brief tips on saving money on your electronic devices:

## 1. Take good care of your devices.
If you want your devices to last for several years, you need to take care of them.

Please don't drop your phone! If you do, make sure to get a tempered glass screen protector and a protective phone case the moment you start using your phone. As for your laptop (or desktop computer), sometimes all you need is an OS reinstall or a hardware upgrade, like upgrading your RAM or your SSD. Dropping your laptop is also a no-no!

## 2. Buy a good, powerful device from a respectable brand.
Some people buy an older model to save money. There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach; companies do tend to offer their previous model at a discount price upon the introduction of their new model. The only problem is that if your brand new phone is an older model, you might need to upgrade it again a couple of years down the road to get acceptable performance.

Old or new, it is very important that you choose your devices from respectable brands, because those companies deliver frequent software updates and tend to take responsibility in case of a manufacturing problem. They also offer decent customer support. Please note that respectable doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Apple is respectable, but so is Lenovo, and unlike Apple, Lenovo is not an expensive brand at all.

For phones, I would stick with iPhone, Samsung, and Google Pixel. However, there are quite a few other good brands out there like Sony, LG, Huawei, OnePlus, and Motorola.

For laptops, I would recommend Dell, Apple, and Lenovo. However, there are quite a few other good brands like Sony, Asus, Microsoft, Samsung, Acer, Fujitsu, HP, and Toshiba (R.I.P.).

## 3. Decide what type of consumer you are
Simply put, there are three types of consumers when it comes to electronic devices:  
A. “I have to have the newest model of everything.”  
B. “I need to buy a new phone because I dropped my older phone in the toilet and flushed it. And the one before that. And the one before that.”  
C. “It's time to buy a new phone because my current phone was built before Instagram was founded.”

The first group buys a new phone, not because they need one, but because they want one. They tend to upgrade to a new phone about once a year. Again, we're not judging people's choices. This whole article is about empowering consumer choices. I personally don't belong to this group. Perhaps mainly because I am not comfortable spending that much money on the luxury of having the newest and shiniest all the time. But also because it is overkill. For instance, switching from your current laptop to a new one involves re-installing all the programs and moving all your files to the new computer. Let's not forget about researching the new models and finding a good deal on the new laptop. When you really think about it, you don't even need most of the shiny features that are added to phones every year. There is a sweet spot somewhere between upgrading to a new device every six months and every ten years, and you need to find that for yourself.

The second group is the people who perhaps drop their phones several times a day. The glass on their phone's display is often shattered, and don't even try to talk to them about battery hygiene—you might find them sitting in the sun, playing games on their phone while the phone is being charged from 2%. The people in this group usually buy a new phone every two years or less. If you fall in this category, I feel you. Phones fall; it happens to everybody—myself included. My advice to you is to, first of all, get a tempered glass screen protector and a protective case for your phone. Next, take a look at your behavior with your device and see if you can improve any of it. Keep it in your pocket to reduce the number of times you drop it, read up on battery hygiene, etc. And if you can't, so be it! At least you know what you are dealing with.

The people in the last group are my favorite! They shop for a new phone less often than the other two groups—perhaps about every 3 to 5 years. They don't upgrade just to make Apple's investors rich, and they don't buy a new phone because they've broken their previous phone. They upgrade when the technology has evolved enough that they decide they want to hop on that train. This is approach is healthy and it saves a lot of money in the long run.

It is very important to know what kind of a consumer you are because that would ultimately determine how long you can keep your device alive. And based on that, you will choose your strategy in upgrading your devices. For example, if you belong to group C, as I do, the tips that I mentioned above work perfectly for you. Every few years you upgrade to a killer device, but it is worth it because you know you are going to take good care of that baby. And even though you may spend a considerable amount to get a powerful device, in the long run, it is not that much, because you hold on to it for several years.

However, if you fall in group B, you might not want to invest in an expensive phone. For you, the strategy of buying one model down might work really well. For example, when iPhone 12 comes to market, you can buy iPhone 11 at a discounted price. You can also look into buying second-hand phones. This way you will save a ton and you won't feel that sorry next time you smash your phone on the ground.

## 4. The strategies for buying great electronic devices with an even greater price tag
- If you are tech-savvy and you know what you're doing, don't be afraid of second-hand and refurbished devices.
- Right after Christmas is a good time to hunt for barely used or unused second-hand phones.
- Dell Refurbished is a haven for second-hand laptops and desktop computers.
