It is no secret that wireless companies charge a hefty price for internet and cell phone plans in North America, especially in Canada. In 2020, [CRTC reported that](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/policymonitoring/2020/cmr5.htm) in 2019 the average price for a mobile plan containing **2 GB of data** was **$40 per month** and for a mobile plan containing **5 GB of data** was **$50 per month**. Moreover, most of the major wireless companies in Canada charge between **$30 to $35 per month** for an **unlimited talk & text** plan <u>with zero data</u>.




## TL;DR
You can save a lot on your phone bill. Here's how:
Get yourself a good data-only mobile plan. If you live in Canada, find a friend or relative who has an existing mobile plan with Fido, Koodo, or Virgin Mobile. Ask that friend to get you a data-only plan, otherwise knowns as a tablet sim card. These three carriers offer 4 GB of data for $15 or $20 per month, but they only offer this plan to customers who have an existing mobile phone plan. Fido offers the best deal among the three and if you use this link, you would get a $50 credit on your new Fido plan.
If you live in the US or elsewhere, do your own research and find the best plan you can. Any plan under $20 is king.
Get a service with VoIP.ms. Their customer service, pricing, and features are superior to any other VoIP service I have encountered.
Install a softphone app on your phone (and/or computer). I recommend Acrobits Groundwire and Bria Mobile.
[Optional] Port out your current phone number to VoIP.ms for free.
If you have some time to spare, I strongly recommend that you read the remainder of this article for more tips and detailed instructions.

## Intro
If I told you that all your life you have been over-charged on your mobile plans by up to 90%, perhaps you wouldn't be surprised. But what if I tell you that you can still turn the tables and save between 60% to 90% on your cell phone bills by switching to a VoIP service and a data-only plan? Actually, your new setting will probably give you more data than your previous plan, and it will definitely give you more freedom of choice and customizability than your existing plan. Never pay for a feature you don't use again! Speaking of costs, there are little to no setup fees and initial costs involved, and if there are any, the total initial cost is far less than what you would already save on the first month. On top of all of that, you won't need to change your phone number to make this switch—If you want, you can keep your existing phone number at no additional cost.
Now that I have your attention, let's discuss this in three sections:
Finding a good VoIP provider for the US and Canada
Finding a good softphone app to use with your VoIP service
Finding a good data-only mobile plan in Canada
But I will first discuss the last topic, because believe it or not, finding a VoIP provider and a softphone app is far easier than finding a good data-only plan that won't cost you a fortune. With my step by step guide, you won't need to have much technical knowledge to set up your VoIP service. In each section, I will give you a clear understanding of all the costs involved, you that you can make an informed decision. Okay then, let's get to it.

## Step 0. Don't get yourself into device contracts and long-term phone plans
### A little about my approach to buying phones and other electronic devices
Generally, I am a “bring your own device (BYOD)” person. I like to keep things simple and untangled. The idea of getting into a two-year contract for anything technology-related really freaks me out! I like to buy my electronic devices (phone, tablet, computer, etc.) on my own terms—whenever I want, whichever model and brand I choose, from whichever store I prefer. This gives me a lot of options when it comes to purchasing phones and other electronic devices.
Here are the major benefits of buying your own device:
### Benefit 1. You are not obligated to your current phone plan → Save $$$ on your wireless plan
When you have a month-to-month plan, you can end your plan when you don't need it, downgrade your plan for a cheaper one, or switch companies whenever you like. This means that you can take advantage of any hot deals that are out there. Companies often offer tempting deals for new customers, and this is especially true about telecom companies (i.e., cell phones, internet, and cable). The first rule of hunting a great deal (a great service for a relatively cheap price) is to keep yourself open for opportunities, and that means: Don't get yourself stuck in a long-term phone contract.
### Benefit 2. You can buy your device on your own terms → Save $$$ on your device
The ideal is to buy the device you want, when you want, from the store you want, at the price you are comfortable paying. This becomes much harder when someone else (the mobile carrier) is making all the decisions on your behalf.
It is all about untangling. Telecom companies like to bundle their products: home internet and cable, wireless plan and cell phone, data plan and unlimited talk & text. Saving money very often comes down to untangling these products: find the best deal for your home internet, find the best deal for your mobile plan, find the best deal for your cell phone. You get the idea.
### “I found a good bundle and I'm in a contract now. What do I do?”
Now, I am not here to say that these bundled plans are evil. But I am saying that in my experience, the sure-fire approach is BYOD. From time to time, some really good phone + plan deals come out, and if one of them meets your requirements, then by all means get on that boat. But unfortunately, what I see more often than I like is that folks make sacrifices on their preferences, just to get the deal that is offered. For example, they opt for a different device model than they desired, or they get fewer GBs of data than they wished for, or they get an unlimited talk & text bundle even though they hardly ever use non-internet means of communication. I say no to all of that, and stick with my BYOD approach.
Also, there are some of us that can't afford to pay upfront for a device, and if that's your situation, I feel you. As I previously said, feel free to consider the phone + plan bundles as one of your options, but please don't think of it as your only option. With a bit of planning and thinking forward, you can get ahead in this game and before you know it, the amount of money you save on your monthly bill can go towards your next dream phone.
If you are in a cell phone contract and you want to get out, give a call to your provider and ask about your options. Also, read the fine print of your contract to see if you would be charged a fine for exiting the contract. And finally, decide for yourself whether it is worth it for you or not. In the end, anything that I am about to tell you today is BYOD, so you would need to have a cell phone device of your own and access to the internet for it to work. From there, the VoIP provider will handle the rest.
### Test the waters first
Don't cancel your current phone plan before you sort out your new setup. First, find your data-only plan, VoIP provider, and softphone app. Then, try out this new setup. See for yourself if it works for you and answers your needs at a fraction of the price. You can even sign up for the VoIP service, install the softphone app, and use them on Wi-Fi for a while, just to see how they work, before investing in your new data-only plan. After you made sure that you like the new setup and that you want to make the switch, think about number porting: If you want to keep your current phone number, you can port it into your VoIP provider's network.
However, you should ask your VoIP provider to initiate the porting, not your current cell phone provider. Your current carrier is the last one who gets the memo on your departure, are we clear on that? I am emphasizing this point because sometimes a carrier might not be happy with the fact that you are leaving and might prevent you from porting out your number. How? Well, if you call your carrier and cancel your plan, then technically from that moment on you don't have any rights to your phone number—Oops. That's why you should first call your new service provider (the VoIP company in our case) and let them handle the porting process. Once everything is done, you can call your old carrier and cancel your account.

## Step 1. Finding a good data-only mobile plan in Canada
### You need data on the go (most probably)
If you need internet on all your devices at all times and places, you will need to pay two internet bills for the foreseeable future: a home internet service to have Wi-Fi (and Ethernet) at your home/office as well as an LTE wireless service on your cell phone. There's just no way around that! I'm one of those people that wants/needs to have internet connectivity 24/7 and at all places. Not because I need to check my social media accounts—I check them less than once a month. But for everything else: I want to be able to call my family and friends via FaceTime on demand, I want to listen to music on Spotify, I want to use Google Maps to navigate, and most importantly, I want to be able to make a Google search whenever I need to.
If you are like me, you probably have some amount of data on your existing mobile plan. Now we need to find you a good data-only plan. After that, we will set up your VoIP service and softphone app, and you are good to go. You can then cancel your existing talk, text & data plan and start saving a ton of money.
If you feel that Wi-Fi is enough for you and you don't need any internet on the go, then I envy you, because this will save you loads of money! In this case, you don't even need a data-only plan and you can skip step 1 and move on to setting up your VoIP service and softphone app. But be aware that with a VoIP service you cannot make or receive any calls if you are not connected to the internet. After all, VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol. So whenever you have Wi-Fi (e.g., at home, at work) you are good. But if you are on the go and you don't have LTE or any other kind of internet connectivity on your phone, you won't be able to make or take calls. In that case, if someone calls your number the VoIP service will transfer it straight to voicemail.
Maybe you are not here to cancel your existing mobile plan, rather you want to get an additional phone number for your small business or for personal use. VoIP is a great option for you; both powerful and extremely affordable. You can have 10 phone numbers in different cities around the world for less than $10 a month, all in a single app on your phone. You can make phone calls or send text messages from any of your phone numbers in an instant. It's really the next level of having phone numbers! If you are happy with your existing data plan and are not really looking to save some money on your monthly bill, you too can skip this step and move on to the next section, where I explain how to set up your VoIP service and softphone app.
In this section, I will show you how to find a good data-only plan in Canada. If you live in the US or elsewhere, do some research yourself and find a data-only mobile plan that best suits your needs and budget.
### Fido: 4 GB for $15 a month (only for customers with an existing phone plan)
A few years ago, Fongo offered a dream data-only plan: 3 GB of data for $15 a month. I jumped on that train pretty quickly! After that, Fido discontinued that plan for new customers and now only offers it to customers who already have a phone plan with Fido. Slick! Officially, this is a tablet plan meant to be a second sim card that an existing customer puts in her tablet, but what do they know? As long as you pay the bill, whether you put that sim card in a tablet or phone is your business. If you have a family member or close friend who has an existing plan with Fido—well, then you should recommend that they switch to VoIP too! But if they're going to stick with their Fido plan, you can ask them to get a tablet sim card for you. This is the name Fido uses for their data-only plan. The plan now offers 4 GB of data for $15 a month (plus tax). This is the best data-only deal you can find in Canada at the moment—I personally guarantee that. On top of that, you can use this link to get a $50 credit on your new Fido plan.
###  Koodo and Virgin Mobile: 4 GB for $20 a month (only for customers with an existing phone plan)
Koodo and Virgin Mobile offer a data-only (tablet) plan similar to Fido, only $5 more expensive. Again, call your friends and see what you can do.
### Other data-only plans
If you can't find a family member, friend, or relative who has an existing mobile plan with Fido, Koodo, or Virgin Mobile, then I'm afraid these generous data-only plans are off the table. But you can find the next best deal on WhistleOut's Plan Finder. With any company, small or big, you should check which network they are actually using (Bell, Telus, or Rogers) and I also recommend that you take a look at their coverage map.
Public Mobile, Lucky Mobile, and Fido (use this link to get a $50 credit) all offer a data-only plan which includes 250 MB of data for $15 a month. This is far from ideal, but it is the cheapest plan available out there. Believe it or not, if you only use this data for your VoIP service, it will be more than enough. But as you know, all apps are data-hungry and unless you meticulously set your settings for data usage of the apps, you may easily use up your allowance in less than a week.
One more thing that you should pay attention to is that some of these companies charge you a one-time setup fee. Make sure you read the order details, as you may be able to wave the setup fee by activating your service online.
Look, it all boils down to this: Telecom companies are greedy! Even after you cut your phone bill by 75% using my trick, the majority of what you keep paying goes to your wireless provider (for your data-only plan), as the VoIP service would only cost you $3 to $5 a month.
I understand that building, growing, and maintaining wireless networks is extremely costly, and I agree that telecom companies should make a good profit for doing that. However, charging the customers $30 a month just for a talk & text plan is ridiculous. And that's what we're trying to change today. Would it be great if you could also get a flexible data plan on your cell phone for $10 a month? Of course. But we live in a different world right now. Let's try to get the best deal we can.
Now that you have your affordable data plan up and running, we are ready to get you a VoIP service. This will replace your existing talk & text plan and will give you so many more features.

## Step 2. Finding a good VoIP provider for the US and Canada
### Appetizer: Google Voice and Google Hangouts
If you live in the US, Google Voice offers you free calling and texting to North America, call forwarding, call blocking, and voicemail transcription. You also have the option to port your existing number into Google Voice at a $20 one-time cost. I'm a huge Google fan, so if you live in the US I would recommend that you give this a try. However, note that unlike Google Voice, VoIP.ms does not charge you anything to port your existing phone number into their system. Also, Google Voice only provides one phone number per Google account, whereas with a VoIP service like VoIP.ms there is no limit to the number of phone numbers you can have.
If you live in Canada, a partial alternative to Google Voice is Google Hangouts. Other than the original in-app messaging, video, and voice calling features, Google Hangouts offers free calling within the US and Canada. The catch is that you cannot receive any phone calls using Hangouts, because you won't have a phone number with it. Therefore, whenever you call someone's phone number using Hangouts, they will see the word Unknown on their caller ID. So this is by no means a comprehensive VoIP solution.
### VoIP services: An introduction
There are many other “VoIP” apps out there that you might have heard of. Hangouts and Skype are among the most popular ones. But these apps aren't really VoIP services. They are a combination of a VoIP service and a softphone app but don't offer the same range of features. The more accurate term for these apps is video, voice, and messaging apps.
In contrast, VoIP service providers often don't have their own app. They offer the integration between the national phone network and the internet protocol and you can use their service using the internet in different ways. One way is by using a landline phone that connects to the internet—similar to the phone system of corporations. The other way is by using a softphone app. This is a generic app for phones and/or computers, made by a software company, and it can be used with any VoIP service provider. You just need to enter the correct settings—much like setting up your email in an email app on your phone or computer.
There are two main groups of users that look for VoIP solutions:
Businesses (small, medium, large)
With many phone lines and complex phone routing needs, businesses are a natural customer for VoIP services. Businesses have been migrating from traditional copper-wire telephone systems to VoIP systems to save thousands of dollars on phone bills. Moreover, VoIP offers advanced features with such flexibility that traditional phone lines cannot match. Some of these features include digital receptionist (IVR), calling queues, call forwarding, call routing, audio conferencing, callback, voicemail, and call recording.
Consumers
Many consumers like you and I choose to replace their phone plans (cell phone or landline) with VoIP services. This can save them up to 90% on their monthly phone bill. Moreover, the features mentioned above are quite interesting and useful even for personal use. With VoIP, you can easily have 10 phone numbers in different cities around the world for the cost of one phone number on a traditional phone carrier.
To connect to a VoIP service provider, you need some form of a VoIP phone. This can be done in various ways:
A softphone app installed on your phone and/or computer. This implementation does not require the purchase and installation of any hardware. In this article, we focus on this approach.
A dedicated VoIP phone which connects to your internet network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. You would need to purchase this VoIP phone. This option is ideal for corporate offices and the three people who still own landline phones at home!
A phone adapter that connects to your internet network and your ordinary landline phone and handles the VoIP functionality. You would need to purchase this phone adapter. If you already have a landline phone at your home or office, this might be a cheaper alternative to buying a VoIP phone.

## The best VoIP provider I have found: VoIP.ms
There are plenty of VoIP service providers out there. Many of their features are quite similar, but the main things that differ among them are:
Customer service
Pricing model
Cost of number porting
User interface (web portal)
Advanced features
I have done a lot of research to choose my VoIP provider, and I can tell you that by any of the above measures, VoIP.ms wins by a landslide. 
### Customer service
The VoIP.ms support staff are always there to help you through live chat and email. They are knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. In my experience and according to many of their testimonials, the support they offer ranks at the top of their industry.
VoIP.ms also has a really good support wiki, full of useful information and instructions. I definitely recommend taking a look at it.
### Unbeatable pricing model
You can choose a new phone number from any city in the United States or Canada for only ¢85 ($0.85 USD) a month. International numbers are also available in 46 other countries, at a higher monthly rate.
After that, calls are charged per minute and SMS text messages are charged per message:
Outgoing calls are charged at ¢0.5 ($0.005 USD) per minute in Canada and double that in the US.
Incoming calls are charged at ¢0.9 ($0.009 USD) per minute in Canada and the US. Whenever you notice that your monthly cost is growing higher than $4.25, you can switch to the Unlimited plan, which costs $4.25 USD per month (in contrast with the $0.85 USD per month for the Pay Per Minute plan). After that, all your incoming calls are free. Note that you would still be charged for your outgoing calls at the same rate.
Text messages are charged at ¢0.75 ($0.0075 USD) per SMS message and multimedia messages are charged at ¢2 ($0.02 USD) per MMS message.
Consult their website for the rate of international calls. Toll-free numbers, virtual fax numbers, and other kinds of numbers are also available at different rates.
Personally, with my normal usage of 180 minutes (incoming + outgoing) and 40 SMS messages (sent + received) per month, I end up paying less than $2.50 USD per month for my VoIP service (this includes the ¢85 for the phone number). Many other VoIP services start at $15 a month, which is not at all accomodating.
### Free number porting
A huge plus for VoIP.ms is that it does number porting for free. This means that you can move your current phone number from your existing provider to VoIP.ms for free. Many other companies charge you about $25 for this service (like the dishonorable Fongo app) and Google Voice.
When porting your number, it is extremely important that you call the receiving company (in this case VoIP.ms) before calling the sending company (in this case your existing carrier). Sometimes a carrier might not be happy with the fact that you are leaving and might play ugly in terms of allowing you to port out your number.
### User interface (web portal)
VoIP.ms is full of useful features. In their web portal, these features are organized into several menus, including:
Finances: Check your account balance and transaction history.
CDR and Reports: Check your call detail records.
DID Numbers: The majority of the features are located in this menu. From here you can order a new DID (short for direct inward dialing, it's a fancy term for phone numbers), create or modify a voicemail, create or modify a digital receptionist (IVR), add custom music on hold, and much more.
### Enhanced features
Beyond standard features such as caller ID, call waiting, voicemail, and call forwarding, VoIP.ms offers a range of enhanced features. Most of these features come free with your VoIP service:
Digital receptionist (IVR)
Calling queues
Call routing
Audio conferencing
Callback
Call recording
Music on hold
Time conditions
Number portability
Online SMS message center
Enhanced 911 emergency services
It will take less than 5 minutes to set up your account. Just head over to their website at VoIP.ms and sign up. If you sign up using this link, you will get $10 of free credits after making your first call.

## Step 3. Finding a good softphone app to use with your VoIP service
Now that you have your VoIP service set up, you need to install a softphone app on your phone to use it. You will be using this app when making and receiving calls, sending and receiving text messages, checking your voicemail, and so on. Basically, this app is the front-end and your VoIP service is the back-end, much like your email app and email service provider. There are plenty of softphone apps out there and VoIP.ms works with any of them. They even have a page on their wiki which contains an exhaustive list of 27 softphone apps for different operating systems.
Many of these apps are free and some are paid; some are open source. Many of them have old and clunky user interfaces and some are very nice. You can try a few of them and choose for yourself, or you can trust my judgment and pick from the following list. Once you pick your app, you can find the detailed setup instructions for it in the above link.
### Acrobits Groundwire (✔ my recommendation)
$14 one-time
iOS and Android
This is the best of the bunch. Frankly, you don't even have to read the rest! Groundwire's user interface is gorgeous and the app is very stable. It has all the standard features of a softphone and more. It also gives you the option to record your phone calls.
Another thing that appeals to me is the one-time price tag. You pay $14 and the app is yours for life. Many other paid softphones charge you a similar amount, but annually. You are probably going to use this app for many years, so the potential saving can be considerable. As far as initial cost goes, this is your only significant cost, and perhaps the activation fee on your data-only plan (which you should try to waive).
Is it worth it to pay money for this app when there are free softphone apps out there? Absolutely. First of all, good luck finding a free softphone that is full-featured and completely stable—meaning when someone is calling your phone number, the app would actually ring 100% of the time. Some of them are freemiums—they give you some features for free and sell you the rest. Second, purely on aesthetics, I have tried many softphone apps before settling on this one, and to my experience, the user interfaces of the free softphone apps look completely outdated—like Y2K outdated. Calling and texting are still two main features of a cell phone and I for one don't want to deal with a clunky or buggy user interface when doing that. You can read my other article on why you should avoid Fongo.
### Bria Mobile
$1.39 per month
iOS and Android. Legacy app; scheduled to lose support in 2021.
Do not mistake this with its sister app, Bria Solo, which costs $32 per year and has no SMS capability.
This is my second-favorite on the list. The user interface is very nice and the app is very stable. However, the fact that the app is scheduled to lose support this year worries me. The company that makes Bria Mobile is shifting towards business customers and thinks of this as a legacy app.
### Linphone
Free and open source
Multi-platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux)
Who doesn't like free, right?
This is actually the app that I use on Windows. It's free and I'm happy with it. The iOS version, however, does not seem quite stable and has some bad reviews on the App Store. By 'not stable' I mean, the app's push notifications do not function properly. This means that incoming calls won't ring on the app unless the app is open on the screen. This is a huge issue. Nonetheless, feel free to give it a test drive. With different settings, you might get better results. And the support staff at VoIP.ms are really helpful.
### Zoiper
Freemium. $13 per year for push notifications. Also sells some other features separately.
Multi-platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux)
Okay, this is an easy no for me, primarily because there is a much better alternative: Acrobits Groundwire, which is on top of this list. Groundwire costs $14 as a one-time purchase, whereas Zoiper charges $13 annually for push notifications. There is nothing wrong with Zoiper's user interface, but it just can't compete with Groundwire.
You might think, “Well, if I don't buy the push notification thing, Zoiper is technically free.” You're right, but you can't survive without push notifications! No one wants a phone app that is not going to ring when someone calls you or sends you a text message!
Anyway, this app was good enough that made it to my list, but I for one would not pay for it, and therefore would not use it—in case you missed it, the “free” version is practically unusable.

## Step 4. [Optional] Port out your existing number to your VoIP provider
Now that you have your VoIP service and softphone app set up and working, it is time to consider number porting: If you want to keep your current phone number, you can port it into VoIP.ms at no additional cost.
Note that you should ask VoIP.ms to initiate the porting, not your current cell phone provider. This is extremely important because sometimes a carrier might not be happy with the fact that you are leaving and might prevent you from porting out your number. How? Well, if you call your carrier and cancel your plan before initiating the port out process, then technically from that moment on you don't have any rights to your phone number—Oops. That's why you should first call your new service provider (VoIP.ms in our case) and let them handle the porting process. Once everything is settled, you can call your old carrier to cancel your account. In most cases, the porting process won't take more than 3 to 4 days.

## Final words
Congratulations! You are now on your path to save a lot of money. In fact, if you do a simple calculation, the money you are going to save on your phone bill can easily pay for your phone upgrades for the rest of your life! This is what I have been doing for more than four years now and it's one of the wisest spending decisions I've ever made.
### All-in-one VoIP apps: Mediocre alternatives
There are some apps out there that just like our setup here, provide VoIP service, in the true sense of the word: you get a phone number that others can reach you at. These apps are all-in-one solutions, meaning the company that makes the app provides the backend VoIP service too. Three of these apps that have earned some reputation are textPlus, TextMe, and Fongo. Before we finish, I want to tell you about these three apps, because one of them is a somewhat-acceptable alternative, the other is ridiculously over-priced, and the third one will make your life miserable (hint: Fongo).
In general, these all-in-one VoIP apps don't offer the same range of features as a VoIP service + softphone setup. Advanced features like digital receptionist (IVR), calling queues, call recording, and time conditions are just pipe dreams on these apps. In terms of price, they end up costing the same amount as our setup. The only possible advantage these apps might have is that they don't require setting up. Although, that's not entirely true, as you might still need to do some tweaking in the network settings. These apps work out of the box; just install and use. Whereas with the other setup you first need to find a VoIP service and then find and install a softphone app. But I've already done that part of the work for you in this article. And setting up the whole thing should take you less than 10 minutes.
That being said, let's take a closer look at these three apps and see if any of them are worth being considered as an alternative.
### textPlus: A quick fix for the impatient.
$7 per year to remove ads + $28 per year for unlimited US- and Canada-wide calls. Unlimited text and inbound calls are included for free.
iOS and Android

%%% 2 textPlus screenshots %%%

Let's start with the pros. textPlus is a VoIP app; you install it, create an account, and that's it. In one word, it is simple. If you want to set up your new phone number in 2 minutes instead of 10 minutes, textPlus might be a good option for you.
The app is ad-based and you can use it for free. Unlimited texting to the US and Canada is included for free, as well as unlimited inbound calls. To make phone calls, you can either buy the annual subscription for $28 per year, which gives you unlimited US- and Canada-wide calling, or you can pay per minute. Outbound calls cost ¢2 per minute. The ads can be removed if you pay $7 per year. When you add up these costs, you end up paying about the same amount as a VoIP service and softphone app. If you think you can live with the ads and save on those $7 per year, try the app for a month and think again! Ads are annoying almost anywhere, but on your phone and messaging app, that's just painful.
As for the cons, the first one is all the features of a VoIP service that you would be missing: Digital receptionist (IVR), call recording, music on hold, and more control over voicemail, to name a few. If you think about it, then spending a few more minutes on setting up your phone is definitely worth it.
One problem with freemium services is that sometimes they focus so much on maximizing ad revenue and monetizing the free users that they forget how to appeal to their paid customers. textPlus is definitely an example of that. If you take a look at the app's interface, you will notice that their main focus is the free users.

%%% 3 textPlus screenshots %%%

Half of the buttons at the bottom of the app are assigned to gaining free credits by watching ads and subscribing to services in their marketplace. To the point that they have jammed messaging, call history, and the dial-pad into one button—three main features of any phone app. This is just poor taste in UI design. If you spend $35 per year on an app, you probably expect it to not dedicate a button to Free Credit, where it invites you to open ads, fill in their sign up form, and follow the instructions to gain a few cents of free credit. Poor design.
### TextMe: Ridiculously over-priced.
$12 per month to remove ads
iOS and Android
The company that makes TextMe has two other flagship apps as well: TextMe Up and FreeTone. All three apps have similar features and very similar user interfaces.
TextMe is ad-based and comes with free unlimited calling and texting in the US and Canada. The catch is the advertising. They let you remove the ads if you pay $12 per month, which is ridiculously over-priced and definitely not worth it. But then again, if you think you can make peace with the ads and enjoy a free VoIP app, I'm afraid you are mistaken. The price to remove ads is usually proportional to the ad revenue per user. So, with a hefty price tag of $12 per month, you can probably guess what volume of advertising we are dealing with here. GIF banners, video ads before making a call, video ads before showing you the contact you are looking for, that kind of stuff.
Using the app with the ads is unbearable and if you want to pay this much to remove the ads, you might as well stay with your current carrier! Again, I'm not mentioning these three apps because they are great options; I'm only doing so because many users fall for one of these apps and I want them to read an honest review of them and the better alternatives.
### Fongo: Just don't.
$2.5 per month for unlimited texting to the US & Canada. Unlimited US & Canada calls are included for free.
$7 to remove ads (one-time purchase)
$25 to port in your phone number (optional)
iOS and Android
To keep it short, do yourself a favor and stay away from Fongo. Fongo is a Canadian-based company with an advertising-focused business model. The app is faulty and unstable, and it is just not worth the hassle; not the paid version, and not even the free (ad-based) version.

In fact, this app is so terrible that I have dedicated a separate article to it. Unfortunately, since Fongo offers some features for free and since there are no other Canadian VoIP apps to compete with it, Fongo has received a lot of attention and many Canadian users end up falling for it, even though the company is essentially on idle mode. Their app has not received a substantial update in 12 years, and their business model is built around advertising revenue and milking their existing features as long as they possibly can. And good luck getting any timely or useful support from their customer service.
You don't have to take my word for it. A brief look at the user interface of the app should raise the red flag. And when you look on the support page on their website, you will see how they have explained the various ways their app might stop working and the many errors it might show, but have done little to eliminate those problems in the first place. And as old and archaic as the app looks, it functions just as poorly. Very often you will miss phone calls simply because Fongo didn't ring and you get disconnected on a phone call because of some bug in Fongo's system. I have used Fongo for four years and this is my honest assessment: I didn't know there were better alternatives. I know now, and I will never look back. And now you do too, so just move on.
When it comes to Fongo, I can summarize my advice in one sentence: You deserve better. Seriously!
